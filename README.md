# Ludicro-Bash

This is a collection of various bash scripts that I have created, for either personal or professional use that may publicly listed.

## server-status.sh
This script allows for the monitoring of various services using nmap and discord webhooks.
### Usage
Edit the file to include the names/ports of your service, discord webhook url, and any optional edits to the webhook bot. 
After configuring the file, you will need to have the script run on a schedule (e.g. linux cron jobs)
